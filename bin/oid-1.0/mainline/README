OrthologID automates gene orthology determination within a
character-based phylogenetic framework.  Using external tools,
OrthologID clusters genes into families, creates gene trees,
identifies orthologs, and generates a simultaneous analysis matrix.

OrthologID is a collaborative effort between the American Museum
of Natural History and New York Universtiy.  This software is

PREREQUISITES
=============

Legacy NCBI BLAST 2.2.2x (not BLAST+)
PAUP* 4.0beta10 (http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/)
MCL (http://micans.org/mcl/ ; tested version is 10-201)
Sun Grid Engine (SGE)

INSTALL
=======

1. Create the installation directory (e.g. /opt/orthologid) for OrthologID.

  mkdir <INSTALL-DIR>

2. Clone the OrthologID Mercurial repository (if "hg" is not available,
you need the Mercurial client from http://mercurial.selenic.com/):

  cd <INSTALL-DIR>
  hg clone http://nypg.bio.nyu.edu/repo/oid/mainline

3. Create symlinks to point to these directories:

  ln -s mainline/scripts bin
  ln -s mainline/perllib lib

4. Create the OID_HOME environment variable:

  export OID_HOME=<INSTALL-DIR>

ANALYSIS
========

1. Create a directory for your OrthologID analysis and set
the OID_USER_DIR environment variable to that directory, e.g.

  export OID_USER_DIR=~/bacteriaOID

2. Create a "config" file in $OID_USER_DIR.  A typical config file looks
like this:

INGROUP=Sp1 Sp2 Sp3 Sp4 Sp5 Sp6 Sp7 Sp8
OUTGROUP=Sp9 Sp10
NCPU=4
PEQUEUE=threads
VERBOSE=2
DEBUG=1

In the above config, there are 8 ingroup taxa (INGROUP) and 2 
outgroup taxa (OUTGROUP).  Taxon names must contain alphanumerics ONLY.

NCPU is the number of cores per compute nodes in your cluster.

PEQUEUE is the shared memory Parallel Environment (PE) queue in your
SGE environment.  This is used to run multi-threaded sub tasks of
the pipeline.

3. Format your sequences into fasta files (one per taxon) and put them
in the "blastdb" directory under $OID_USER_DIR.  Each fasta file must
be named after the taxon name specified in the above config file,
e.g. Sp1.faa, Sp2.faa, Sp3.faa, etc.  Currently only PROTEIN sequences
are supported.

In each fasta file, each sequence header (defline) must follow this format:

>TaxonName#SeqID

For example, "Sp1.faa" might look like this:

>Sp1#ABC0001
MVQYNFKRITVVPNGKEFVDIILSRTQRQTPTVVHKGYKINRLRQF
>Sp1#DEF34567
MVQYNFKRITVVPNGKEFVDIILSRTQRQTPTVVHKGYKINRLRQFYMRKVKYTQTN
...

In addition to alphanumerics, the "SeqID" portion may contain dot "."
and underscore "_", but not any other characters.  So "Sp1#ABC001.1"
and "Sp1#ABC001_1" are allowed, but not "Sp1#ABC001-1".

4. Run the OrthologID pipeline 

  nohup $OID_HOME/bin/run_pipeline.sh > run.log 2>&1 &

Check run.log for progress.

5. After the run completes, the following directories/files will exist
in $OID_USER_DIR:

blast: working directory for clustering
data: gene families (one per directory, containing gene family alignment,
gene tree, and ortholog assignments)
log: log files for SGE jobs
matrix.nex: the simultaneous analysis matrix created from all the orthologs

TODO
====

- Migrate to NCBI BLAST+
- Migrate from PAUP* to TNT
- Support for other resource manager, e.g. TORQUE/PBS
- Allow nucleotide sequences
