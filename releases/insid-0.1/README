Requirements
------------

- UNIX/Linux
- perl5
- R (http://www.r-project.org/)
- Mummer (http://mummer.sourceforge.net/)
- Metasim (http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/software/metasim)
- Bioperl (www.bioperl.org)

Setup / Installation
--------------------

- Install Mummer and Metasim and link or copy into $PATH.
- Install bioperl, and if necessary, update $PERL5LB.
- Add bin/ programs insid.pl, insidR.pl and mm.R to a location within $PATH
	(optional if you don't mind calling the programs directly).
- Add lib/ modules Metasim.pm and Mummer.pm to $PERL5LIB.
- Edit config file to contain desired command line options 
	for mummer and metasim, and desired query genome coverages
	if simulating sequence, as in:

	MUMMER=-mum -b -c -F -l 19
	METASIM=--empirical
	COVERAGES=0.05,0.1,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,5,10,20

Example Run
-----------

- Run the insid.pl program to generate PRC curves:
	insid.pl -p <number of processors> -c <run configuration file> 
	-r <reference sequence file> [-s <directory of query reads> ||
	-q <query genome>] -o <output directory>

- Run the insidR.pl to model the PRC curves and derive the COGWES value:
	insidR.pl -i <summary file from insid.pl> -m <slope> 
	-r <location of mm.R script> -o <output directory>

Output Guide
------------

insid.pl:
genome/raw/	Contains the raw mummer output	
genome/results/	Contains parsed mummer output
genome/stderr/	Contains mummer run stderr
metasim/reads/	Contains reads simulated by metasim
metasim/stderr/	Contains metasim run stderr
reads/raw/	Contains raw mummer output for each set of reads
reads/results/	Contains parsed mummer output for each set of reads
reads/stderr/	Contains mummer run stderr's for each set of reads
summaries/	Contains summaries for each set of reads
summary		Compilies all summaries into one final output file

The summary file can be used to plot the PRC curves and model
alignment saturation behavior.

The summary file contains the following fields:
1. query sequence count
2. query sequence length
3. query sequence coverage (if query sequence genome length is known; -q option)
4. number of reference bp covered in the mummer WGA (if query genome supplied; -q option)
5. percent of reference covered in the mummer WGA (again, only if the query genome is supplied; -q option)
6. reference sequence length
7. reference bps covered
8. percent of reference covered

insidR.pl:
R models are saved into a user specified output directory.
Values solved at a given slope for the model generated are printed 
to stdout with the following fields:
1. summary file name
2. K (alignment constant)
3. Rmax (reference covered maximum)
4. slope for which values requested
5. query base pairs required
6. reference base pairs covered
7. slope given reference base pairs covered with WGA (if query genome is supplied; -q)
8. query base pairs required given WGA (requires -q)
9. reference base pairs covered in WGA

For more specific run information, see insid.pl -h and insidR.pl -h.
