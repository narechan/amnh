SUMMARY:

TreeSupports uses PAUP to calculate BS and PBS values for a given
matrix and tree. It can also optionally calculate NDIs when used in 
forked mode (NDI's unavailble to parallel mode for now).

SCRIPTS and MODULES:
TreeSupports is written in PERL.

run_treesupports_forked.pl and run_treesuports_parallel.pl are runner
scripts that execute the TreeSupports process on a multicore machine 
or SGE cluster, respectively.

treesupports_setup.pl, treesupports_run.pl, and treesupports_parse.pl
are scripts that setup, run, and parse TreeSupports results to create 
the TreeSupports summary file, respectively.

TreeSupports.pm contains methods that run various TreeSupports functions.

INSTALLATION:
To install TreeSupports, copy the scipts in bin/ to your $PATH, and 
the modules in lib/ to your $PERL5LIB.

DEPENDENCIES:
TreeSupports requires PAUP for tree reconstruction. Other tree building 
programs can be used if additional runners and parsers are added to 
the TreeSupports.pm library.

TreeSupports requrires bioperl.

CONFIGURATION:
An example configuration file can be found in the distribution directory.
	TREECOMMAND is a string of parameters input to paup	
	TESTS is a space delimited list of tests you want to perform.
	      TESTS should minimally include pbs and bs but can also
	      include ndi.

RUNNING:
See usage instructions accompanying each script. A successful run will require
the launch of either run_treesupports_forked.pl or run_treesupports_parallel.pl 
only, as long as all the other components are correctly installed.

OUTPUT:
The main output is the summary file. It's columns are as follows:
	Part: the partition tested.
	Coords: the coordinates of this partition in the matrix.
	Node: the node tested.
	Topo: the result of the BS topology test
	BSwL: The length of the BS tree with the node constrained to exist
	BSwoL: The length of the BS tree with the node constrained not to exist 
	BS: The bremer support (BSwoL - BSwL)
	PBSunL: Length of the unconstrained PBS tree
	PBSwL: Length of the PBS tree with the node constrained to exist
	PBSwoL: Length of the PBS tree with the node constrained to not exist
	PBS: The partition bremer support (PBSwoL - PBSunL)
	PBSL: The local partition bremer suppor (PBSwoL - PBSwL)
	PHBS : The partition hidden bremer support (PBS - BS)
	PHBSL: The local partition hidden bremer support (PBSL - BS)
	*NDIwLall: The NDI length of all partitions with the node
	           constrained to exist
	*NDIwoLall: The NDI length of all partitions with the node 
	            constrained not to exist
	*NDIwLrm: The NDI length of all partitions minus Part with the node 
                   constrained to exist
        *NDIwoLrm: The NDI length of all partitions minus Part with the node 
                    constrained not to exist
	*NDI: The NDI ( (NDIwoLall - NDIwLall) - (NDIwoLrm - NDIwLrm) )

*optional: exist only if NDI calcs are requested (they can take a long
time to compute).
	
The ouput directory also contains to files that describe the total 
evidence tree: nodes, which indexes all nodes found in the tree; and 
lineages, which indexes all lineages

Runtime logs, cmds, expts and trees for bs, pbs and ndi calculations 
can be found in the subdirectories for each test.
